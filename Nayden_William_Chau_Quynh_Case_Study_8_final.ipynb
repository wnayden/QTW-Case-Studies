    "The purpose of this case study is to implement XGBoost, Random Forest and SVM classification algorithms and evaluate performance based on log loss where applicable (SVM is the exception).  In addition, a rough scaling of SVM using a range of data sample sizes will be approximated.  "

    "# 2 METHODS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RANDOM FOREST (RF)\n",
    "\n",
    "A RandomForest algorithm using the label encoded categorical variables along with our continuous variables as the input. Our baseline log loss was `7.61` and our baseline accuracy was `78%` using the default hyperparameters for RandomForest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were not able to produce tuning with the full complement of all features in the data set within a reasonable run time, so we decided to reduce the number of features. We found that 37 features accounted for >99% of all variance in our initial model, so we used those 37 features for parameter tuning. This process was accomplished via `sklearn`'s `SelectFromModel` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameters we tuned can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`bootstrap` is a statistical resampling technique involving random sampling. Can be true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    ">`max_depth` is the maximum number of levels in each decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    ">`max_features` is the maximum number of features Random Forest is allowed to try in individual tree.\n",
    "\n",
    ">`min_samples_leaf` is the minimum number of leaf nodes you can have.\n",
    "\n",
    ">`min_samples_split` is the minimum number of samples placed in a node before the node is aplit.\n",
    "\n",
    ">`n_estimators` is the number of trees you want to build before taking the maximum voting or averages of predictions. Higher number of trees give you better performance but makes your code slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVC)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Categorical Variables Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "There were 19 categorical features in the dataset that was converted to numerical values for data modeling.  Since we had features with a multitude of categories (features with high cardinality), we would expand the feature space dramatically using one hot encoding with binary values 0 or 1.  Alternatively, for each variable, we examined the frequency of values, kept the values that made up rough 87%-90% of occurrences and combined the rest of the values into a single variable.  In some instances, though the value of occurence per single instance was low, when these low frequency occuring values were combined, their total frequency made up the bulk of the occurence.  This process was used in order to minimize the feature space since support vector machine implementations could take a long time given the size of the dataset.  Categorical features were converted to numerics using label encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Train/Test Split, Cross Validation and Parameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a 70:30 Train/test split of the data containing numerical features and the label encoding of categorical features, SVC() was implemented with RandomizedSearchCV with 3-fold cross validation for tuning of paramters C, gamma, and kernel = 'linear'.  C is a regularization parameter that prevents overfitting and has value range {0.1,10,100,1000} where the strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C.  Gamma has a value range {1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001.0.00001} where the higher the gamma value, the higher the priority is to classify all training examples correctly vs. keeping the decision surface simple and smooth.  Kernel types included 'linear' or 'rbf'.  The combination of C and gamma is important to the performance of the SVC() algorithm and finding the optimal values of C-gamma pairing for each kernel type was done using RandomizedSearchhCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC() algorithm is time consuming and implementation time took several hours without yielding results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Sampling for SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Random samplings of the dataset with sample sizes of 1000,2000,5000 and 10000 were used to test implementation times for  Support Vector Machine classification, SVC(), with 70:30 train/test split and RandommisedSearchCV() with the parameter tuning for a range of 'C'(from 1 to 1000) and 'gamma' (from 0.0001 to 1).  For each sample sizes, the algorithm was implemented with 3-fold cross validation, and 30 iterations.  Performance was evaluated using classification report for F1-score and accuracy as well as confusion matrix. Lastly, verbose = 1 was chosen for progression tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### XGBOOST (XGB)\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model using the label encoded categorical variables along with  continuous variables as the input. Our baseline log loss was `0.55` and our baseline accuracy was `76%` using the default hyperparameters for XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameters we tuned using grid search can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `colsample_bytree` is the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. Subsampling occurs once for every tree constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `eta` Step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting. After each boosting step, we can directly get the weights of new features, and eta shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `eval_metric` is the way we will evaluate our best set of parameters, in this case `logloss`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `max_depth` is the maximum depth of a tree. Increasing this value will make the model more complex and more likely to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `min_child_weight` is the minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child. A larger weight will result in a more conservative algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `objective` is the type of algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "> `subsample` is the subsample ratio of the training instances. A value of 0.5 means half the data would be randomly sampled."

    "### SAMPLE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIER\n",

    "# 4 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost Classifier is the best algorithm to use for this dataset based on log loss of 0.47 and accuracy of 77%.  Comparatively, Random Forest Classifier yielded a log loss of 7.35 with 79% accuracy.  In addition, XGBoost took about 2 hours to run in contrast to over 5 hours for Random Forest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machine (SVM) was the worst performer as measured by implementation time, due to the sample size.  Based on a random sampling of sample size, accuracies ranged from 75%-77%, but runtime very time consuming.  In addition, the confusion matrix revealed that SVM only yielded false positives and true negatives, therefore, evaluating model performance based on accuracies alone can be misleading.  Moreover, random sampling for the SVM samples may have caused imbalanced subsets of the data, which may impact the results as shown by the confusion matrices.  "
